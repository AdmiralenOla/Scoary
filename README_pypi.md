Scoary - Microbial pan-GWAS
###########################

`Scoary <https://github.com/AdmiralenOla/Scoary>`_ is designed to take the gene_presence_absence.csv file from `Roary <https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/>`_ as well as a traits file created by the user and calculate the assocations between all genes in the accessory genome and the traits. It reports a list of genes sorted by strength of association per trait.
